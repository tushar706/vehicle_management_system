      <h2>About Auto Mobile Management System</h2>
			<p>A motor vehicle service or tune-up is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has travelled a certain distance. The service intervals are specified by the vehicle manufacturer in a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel. A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, which is the modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification, rather than using maintenance to keep the engine running as it should.</p>
			<p>The completed services are usually recorded in a service book which is rubber-stamped by the service centre upon completion of each service. A complete service history usually adds to the resale value of a vehicle.</p>
			<p>Experienced service advisors in dealerships and independent shops recommend schedule intervals, which are often in between the ideal or extreme service schedule. They base it on the driving conditions and behaviour of the car owner or driver.</p>
